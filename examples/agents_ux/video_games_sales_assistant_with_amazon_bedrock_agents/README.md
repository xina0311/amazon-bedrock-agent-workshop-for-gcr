# A Tutorial on Deploying the Data Analyst Assistant for Video Game Sales Using Amazon Bedrock Agents

This solution provides a Generative AI application reference that enables users to access structured data stored in a PostgreSQL database through a question-answering assistant.

The assistant generates appropriate SQL queries to retrieve the requested data, provides answers in natural language, and creates data visualizations to enhance the user experience.

**Also, you can change the data source to connect to your preferred database engine by adapting the Agent's instructions and the Lambda function logic.**
